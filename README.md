# MacChromeCalendarFocus
This simple script finds the Chrome tab with Google Calendar and brings it to the front.  If there is no tab with Google Calendar open it will open one for you.  

I am constantly in my calendar or looking for it within my many windows.  Lets face it the Chrome UI is best for Google Calendar.  Believe me I've tried them all, Outlook, Mail App, and many more that I don't like or remember.   Enjoy!

To Install:
1.  Open in Applescript editor
2.  Compile and test the script in editor, it should bring up the calendar in front of all other windows
3.  Save the script to a local folder, set the "File Format" to "Application"
4.  Change the icon if you wish, A good tutorial is here: http://youtu.be/PDmUmo5EOGw?t=1m36s
5.  Drag your new icon to your desktop or dock.
