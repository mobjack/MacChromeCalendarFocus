# MacChromeCalendarFocus
This simple script finds the Chrome tab with Google Calendar and brings it to the front.  If there is no tab with Google Calendar open it will open one for you.  I am constantly in my calendar, and lets face it the chrome UI is best for Google Calendar.  Believe me I've tried them all, Outlook, Mail App, and many more that I don't like or remember.   Enjoy!
